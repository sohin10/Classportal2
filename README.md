# Milestone 2

I started developing the class portal based on the design I created in Adobe Xd, where I had previously sketched out the structure of my website. 


### CONCEPT/THEME:
Before beginning to write code, I prepared all of the HTML pages that I had intended for my website. I knew I had 4 different HTML pages, a landing page which would contain the main three projects and when you clicked on one of the projects it would take you to the detail page of that project where you could explore and read more about the project and 3 main buttons, one that would take you to the labs page(which would then take you to each lab project's detailed page), second button would take you to the github page where you can explore the codes for all the projects a third button would take you to the github page 
The internal detail project pages feature the identical layout for both the main projects and the lab projects, as well as two buttons, one of which leads to the complete project on the web and the other to the code for that specific project. 

Firstly, I created the basic style of my landing page using HTML and added plain text.  After completing the HTML for the landing page, I went on to coding its CSS. I wanted to create each HTML page alongside CSS so I could modify it as I added more code and edited it.  I used the same procedure for the remaining pages. 



### STRUGGLES WITH CSS: 
CSS was far more difficult to write than HTML for each of these sites. I began creating and calibrating my CSS for a desktop screen, which was, in my view, the worst mistake I made when developing the CLASS Portal website. My landing page and the labs page were supposed to have the hover effect, however it wasn't covering the complete page or you could only see half of the picture while hovering over that portion. Even though I was having trouble with these designs, I proceeded to create the CSS for the other pages and added comments and code as I went. 
While designing the detail project and lab pages, the text and picture did not fit next to one another; either the text took up too much space or the image was too huge and I was unable to scale it down. And once again, I continued to manipulate and write more code while commenting on the stuff I didn't want. 
Commenting out code helped me when developing code since it allowed me to see how two different styles would work and feel. 
My main obstacle was when I found that my website was not responsive. It frustrated me since I retried to modify my CSS code with the intention that it would function on a smaller screen, but it began to disrupt my whole layout. At this point, I had had around five mental breakdowns, sobbed eight times, and wanted to throw my laptop fifteen times, and I was ready to give up. And at this stage, my main CSS page was quite crowded, to my dismay. I was unable to determine how to fix my code

### HOW I CORRECTED MY CODE
I took a deep breath, went for a stroll, returned, opened my laptop, and resolved to start again. This video (https://youtu.be/ZYV6dYz4HA) walked me through the fundamentals of creating a responsive website. I did not need to make any changes to my HTML pages; I just needed to concentrate on CSS. 
Hence, I built a new CSS file and began redesigning my web pages. I started with the project detail page since it seemed simpler, as it lacked hover effects and just had text and an image. This time, I began with the iPhone screen size, wrote code and designed it to fit, and then used the @media tag to scale it up to accommodate an iPad and desktop screen. When seen on these displays, the website was now responsive and effectively wrapped around. I then added two buttons.  I used the same structure of the project page and created a new css file in order to develop the lap project detail page, since both of them had the same layout. The design of these pages has changed somewhat from my initial concept, but it now appears better. 

After completing them, I worked on my main landing page. This is when the difficulty increased once again. But using the same processes as the project page, I built a new css file, incorporated part of my old code, and changed it so that it now adapts to all screen widths. My labs page still utilizes the main CSS page I designed initially, and it still functions nicely. 

I am pleased with how the website functions and appears on all devices, and it felt so nice to have it responsive!

### NEXT FOUR IMPORTANT CHANGES (as of now) 
The images I'm using presently are photographs I took on my trip to Europe; they will be changed with images of the projects and lab work. 
Since I indicated in my milestone-1 process blog, I had settled on an earthy-toned color palette. However, I believe I would modify that, as it does not seem visually attractive at the moment, and I would change the appearance (color palette) to match the images and look beautiful. 
Presently, the most significant modification and problem is that the image changes when you hover over it on a desktop computer, however the hover effect does not function on mobile or tablet devices. Therefore, I believe that rather than having the images display when you hover over them (on mobile/tablet, they now appear when you click), I would put the images as backdrops for each project.
